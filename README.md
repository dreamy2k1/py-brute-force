## Description  
This Python script implements a brute force algorithm to maximize profits by analyzing numerical sequences and identifying patterns. It processes a list of numerical inputs, applies specific transformations, and determines the most profitable instructed sequence based on recurring patterns.

## Features  
- Applies three transformation steps (`step_1`, `step_2`, `step_3`) to generate price sequences.  
- Calculates differences between consecutive elements in the sequences.  
- Identifies patterns and their corresponding indices across all sequences.  
- Computes and outputs the highest profit along with the associated instructed sequence.  
- Supports handling large datasets efficiently.

## How It Works  
1. **Input Handling**:  
   - Reads input from a file (`sample_2.txt`) or uses default numerical values.  
2. **Transformations**:  
   - Each input number undergoes transformations using `step_1`, `step_2`, and `step_3`.  
3. **Pattern Matching**:  
   - Identifies target patterns in sequences of price differences.  
   - Matches patterns across all sequences to compute indices and potential profits.  
4. **Profit Calculation**:  
   - Calculates total profit based on matched patterns and determines the most profitable instructed sequence.  

## Example Input File (`sample_2.txt`)
